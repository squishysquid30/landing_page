    <h3 id="blue_title">Blue Poison Dart Frog</h3>
      <p>In the wild the frogs' lifespan is 4 to 6 years. Frogs that are kept in captivity live 10 to 12 years. The frogs get there toxins from the insects that they eat in the wild. In the wild the blue poison dart frog eats ants, termites, and tiny beetles. In captivity the frogs eat ants, flightless fruit flies, tiny beetles, and termites. The frogs get their toxins when they become adults. Adult blue poison dart frogs don't have many predators because of their toxins. It is mainly the baby frogs that have predators since they don't have any toxins yet. The main predator of the frogs is the fire bellied snake that has developed a resistance to the frogs' poison. If the frogs are kept in captivity the insects that they are fed do not give them the toxins that they would get from the insects in the wild.</p>

    <h3 id="strawberry_title">Strawberry Poison Dart Frog</h3>
      <p>In captivity the strawberry poison dart frog can live up to 17 years. They become poisonous by the mites and ants that they eat in the wild. In captivity strawberry poison dart frogs can eat ants, mites, fruitfles, beetles, spiders, and termites. The strawberry poison dart frogs don't have many predators because of their toxins but their main predator similar to the blue poison dart frogs is the fire bellied snake. The tadpoles' venom glands are underdeveloped so they are more preyed upon than the adults are. The strawberry poison dart frogs kept in captivity never develop the toxins the frogs in the wild do and you are able to hold the frogs.</p>
